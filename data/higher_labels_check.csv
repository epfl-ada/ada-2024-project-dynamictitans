339526,Michel's death scene is one of the most iconic scenes in the film,3

339526,a slang verb meaning &#34,3
339526,s translation obscures the subtlety of Vital&#39,3
339526,it is not clear whether Vital misquotes him deliberately,1
339526,Other translations have made the possibility that Vital mishears Michel more apparent,1
339526,In the English captioning of the 2001 Fox-Lorber Region One DVD,3
339526,What did he say? VITAL,1
339526,What's a scumbag?  The 2007 Criterion Collection Region One DVD uses a less literal translation that renders the French into a familiar American colloquialism,1
339526,Makes me want to puke,3
339526,What did he say? VITAL,1
339526,He said you make him want to puke,3

3129169,In an early episode of Kim Ki-duk’s Samaritan Girl,3
3129169,the adolescent Jae-yeong  tells her classmate and best friend Yeo-jin  the tale of an Indian prostitute named Vasumitra whose clients,3
3129169,as the curious legend goes,5
3129169,became devout Buddhists after their sexual encounter with her,3
3129169,It is an innocuous topic of conversation that takes on an inherently disagreeable tone within the context of their troubling activity,3
3129169,as the demure Yeo-jin helps the more uninhibited Jae-yeong apply make-up in preparation for a rendezvous with an older client,3
3129169,a transactional “date” arranged by Yeo-jin on her friend’s behalf  through an online chat,3
3129169,The fanciful Jae-yeong interprets the anecdotal spiritual awakening as a testament to Vasumitra’s feminine prowess,3
3129169,and it is this naive belief in sexuality’s nurturing,4
3129169,revelatory potential that seems to embolden Jae-yeong into following through with their sordid enterprise,0
3129169,Determined to reach their superficial goal of earning enough money to be able to travel to Europe,1
3129169,and seemingly obsessed with the mythical prostitute’s powers of transfiguration,3

3129169,in the presence of her trusted lookout Yeo-jin,1
3129169,will lead to an irrational and tragic leap of faith,0
3129169,The recurring theme of transcendence through a transformative encounter defines the course of the film,3
3129169,as Yeo-jin attempts to come to terms with her complicity in Jae-yeong’s incomprehensible act by retracing her friend’s liaisons through a meticulously kept personal diary that had also served as an account of their financial progress towards their hoped-for European trip,3
3129169,Contacting each client under the familiar pretence of shared intimate history,3
3129169,Yeo-jin embarks on a guilt-ridden journey of sexual and financial restitution,0
3129169,arranging to reunite with each of Jae-yeong’s “dates”,3

3129169,then concluding their meeting by returning the money once given to her friend by them,3
3129169,obliquely Samaritan act proves cathartic to the thoughtless,3
3129169,turning their seemingly inconsequential dalliance with the under-aged prostitute into a humbling moment of reckoning for the transgressions and emptiness in their own lives,3
3129169,as Yeo-jin perseveres in her humiliating,3
3129169,the toll becomes even more unbearable for her doting father,0
3129169,a widowed police detective named Yeong-ki  who,3

3129169,becomes an inadvertent witness to his only child’s unfathomable descent into prostitution,3
3129169,a discovery that ironically occurs as he investigates the crime scene of a violently murdered young woman – most likely,4
3129169,another under-aged prostitute – in an opposite room of a similarly decorated love motel,3
3129169,Consumed by a sense of impotence over his daughter’s debasement and corruption,0
3129169,he begins to follow Yeo-jin as she conducts her bizarre,4
3129169,and exploring such spiritually fundamental themes as sin,3
3129169,the film suggests a cursory – but fitting – modern-day parallel to the tripartite structure and redemptive themes of Dante Alighieri’s epic narrative poem,3
3129169,Set in the alienating urban landscape of contemporary Seoul,4
3129169,The Samaritan Girl is a figurative descent into the soulless,3
3129169,impersonal spaces of anonymous Internet chat rooms,4
3129169,These are the spaces that Jae-yeong inhabits in a misguided quest for connection and material gain,0
3129169,and that Yeo-jin must later traverse in order to expiate her own feelings of culpability,0
3129169,the film is also a chronicle of spiritual dilemma,4
3129169,intrinsic to the sentiment of wishing to bear another person’s burden  that motivates the actions of both the prodigal daughter,3
3129169,It is this figurative Christ-like cross-bearing for the perceived sins of others that is illustrated in the indelible image of Yeo-jin carrying a critically injured,0
3129169,partially clothed Jae-yeong on piggyback through the crowded city streets to seek medical assistance at a nearby hospital,4
3129169,The title of the concluding chapter,3
3129169,provides a further useful insight into the thematic structure of the film,1
3129169,Alluding through this title to the contrasting movements within a single musical composition,3
3129169,the film is also an illustration of contrasting reactions to similar transgressions,3
3129169,The recurring images of cleansing between Jae-yeong and Yeo-jin are intimate,3
3129169,the image of Yeo-jin’s shower after leaving the hospital – later recalled in a similar shot of Yeong-ki – is devastating,3
3129169,while Yeo-jin and Yeong-ki can see past the failings and imperfections of others,0
3129169,Inasmuch as Yeo-jin serves as a passive and enabling protector of Jae-yeong in her seemingly voluntary exploitation,3
3129169,Yeong-ki’s responsibility as his daughter’s guardian and omnipresent watcher becomes more complex and inescapable,3
3129169,Resorting to dispensing small doses of anecdotal parable and recounting cryptic,3
3129169,Fatima-like visions of apocalypse to a preoccupied Yeo-jin as he drives her to school,3
3129169,Yeong-ki does not confront his daughter with his shattering discovery,3
3129169,he turns his grief inward and begins to confront his daughter’s “dates” after their encounters with her,3
3129169,Casting the proverbial first stone onto the car windows of a married businessman  in a secluded field,3
3129169,Yeong-ki’s innately protective paternal role turns from brooding sentinel to avenging angel,2

2688210,The working-class Short ears have no ear plugs and a different tattoo,3
2688210,Young men from each Long Ear tribe compete in the annual Birdman Competition,3
2688210,The winner’s tribe gets to rule the island for a year,3
2688210,Ariki-mau has been the Birdman  for 20 years,3
2688210,He has a conviction that one day the gods would arrive in a great white canoe and take him to heaven,3
2688210,His advisor tells him to build more and bigger moai statues to curry favor with the gods and encourage them to come sooner,3
2688210,Ariki-mau petulantly rejects the latest statue – which stands over 20 feet tall – as too small,3
2688210,The Short Ear workers are forced to build an even bigger statue in an impossibly short amount of time,3
2688210,The king’s advisor ruthlessly enforces the rules and status quo by publicly killing a Short Ear fisherman who had accidentally caught a taboo fish,3
2688210,Long-Ear Noro  and Ramana,3
2688210,are both rejects in their tribes – her father was banished for building an unlucky canoe,0

2688210,The king’s advisor claims that Ramana's skin is too dark,4
2688210,"and that she should be purified by spending the time from now until the Birdman Competition  in the ""Virgin’s Cave""",4
2688210,He checks her virginity and snidely remarks to Noro,3
2688210,who is watching Ramana being lowered to the cave,3
2688210,that she isn’t right for the Virgin’s Cave and that it will be their little secret,0
2688210,Ramana takes one last look at the sunset and goes into the cave,3
2688210,Noro approaches Ramana’s banished father,3
2688210,and asks him to help him train for the Birdman competition,3
2688210,He initially refuses because it is Noro’s fault that his daughter is confined to a cave,3
2688210,but later relents and trains Noro,3
2688210,While training Noro he explains that he and Noro's father were great friends once and that he actually gave the canoe to Noro's father,3
2688210,He further explains that Noro's father sailed away after discovering a piece of a shipwrecked Spanish Galleon,0
2688210,thus breaking the long held belief that Rapa Nui is the only land left with people on the Earth,3
2688210,the Short Ears are beginning to starve because the king insists on them working on the new statue instead of growing food but continues taking the full quota of their remaining food for the Long Ears,3
2688210,The resources of the island are being rapidly used up and depleted,0
2688210,due to the extensive Moai construction and overpopulation,3
2688210,Noro is the only person worried about the resource depletion,4
2688210,but his concerns are dismissed by the increasingly senile Ariki-mau,3
2688210,Noro sneaks some food to his short ear friend Make  and shares his plans to marry Ramana,3

2688210,Make declares that they are no longer friends and runs off,3
2688210,both Noro and Make visit Ramana at her cave,3
2688210,bringing her food and talking to her through the barrier at the mouth of the cave,3
2688210,They both declare their love to her,2
2688210,but she sounds rather despondent,0
2688210,After a supply shortage results in the death of one of the Short Ears  the Short Ears demand that they get half of the wood,3
2688210,food and other materials and that they are allowed to compete in the Birdman Competition,3
2688210,The King's Advisor initially refuses and orders their death however the King gives in to their demands after realizing that if the Short Ears die no one will build the Moai,3
2688210,The King however only allows them to compete after the Moai has been completed and he makes the condition that if the Short Ear competitor loses then he will be sacrificed,3
2688210,Despite these conditions Make accepts the position of the Birdman Competitor on the condition he marries Ramana if he wins,3
2688210,The King agrees and Make spends all his time working and training,3
2688210,leaving no time for sleep or other recreational activities,3
2688210,work on the great Moai has become so important that the Short Ears even sacrifice their food to complete it,1
2688210,Finally it is the Birdman Competition,3
2688210,Nine competitors must swim out to a close-by islet surrounded by pounding surf,3
2688210,climb the cliffs to get an egg from the nest of a sooty tern and bring it back,3
2688210,The first to return wins for his tribe,3
2688210,Noro barely wins and Ariki-mau gets to be the island's ruler for another year,3
2688210,Ramana is brought from the cave,3
2688210,pale from her long underground stay and very pregnant,4
2688210,Before anything is decided about the fate of Ramana or Make,3
2688210,an iceberg is spotted off the coast,4
2688210,Ariki-mau believes that the iceberg is the great white canoe sent to take him to the gods and goes out to it with some of his followers,3
2688210,After the iceberg has carried Ariki-mau away,3
2688210,the advisor attempts to seize control of the island,3
2688210,but Make kills him and the Short Ears stage a rebellion,3
2688210,slaughtering and even cannibalistically eating the remains of the Long Ears,3
2688210,as Make allows him to live,3
2688210,Ramana and their baby escape the island in a canoe Ramana’s father built,4
